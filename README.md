Boundary and Region Identification Software Kit

The Boundary and Region Identification Software Kit (BRISKit) was written for MATLAB and was used to develop the AustinMan and AustinWoman Electromagnetic Voxel Models (http://bit.ly/AustinMan) from the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project.

BRISKit is used to segment color images and identify the tissues present in the cross-sectional anatomical images.

See the BRISKit_User_Guide.pdf for additional information.

Updates to BRISKit will be posted soon with more code comments to aid future developers.
